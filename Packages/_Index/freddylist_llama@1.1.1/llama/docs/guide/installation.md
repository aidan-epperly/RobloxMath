# Installation

There are a few ways to get started with Llama.

## Method 1: Import model file

1. Download the `.rbxmx` model file from the latest release on the [Llama releases page](https://github.com/F-RDY/llama/releases).
2. Insert the model anywhere in a Roblox place!

## Method 2: Good ol' copy + paste

1. Copy the `src` directory of Llama into your project.
2. Rename it to `Llama`.
3. Make sure you put [`t`](https://github.com/osyrisrblx/t) under the Llama directory. (this step will hopefully be resolved in the future by package managers or Luau type-checking)
4. Use something like [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) to sync your project to Roblox Studio!

## Method 3: Git submodule

1. Navigate to where you want to keep your submodules in Git bash.
2. Run `git submodule add https://github.com/F-RDY/llama.git`.
3. Using something like [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo), set up your project to sync `Llama/src` into Roblox Studio!

## Method 4: Package manager
