## Installation

There are a few ways to get started with Llama.

### Method 1: Import model file

1. Download the `.rbxmx` model file from the latest release on the [Llama releases page](https://github.com/F-RDY/llama/releases).
2. Insert the model anywhere in a Roblox place!

### Method 2: Good ol' copy + paste

1. Copy the `src` directory of Llama into your project.
2. Rename it to `Llama`.
3. Make sure you put [`t`](https://github.com/osyrisrblx/t) under the Llama directory. (this step will hopefully be resolved in the future by package managers or Luau type-checking)
4. Use something like [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) to sync your project to Roblox Studio!

### Method 3: Git submodule

1. Navigate to where you want to keep your submodules in Git bash.
2. Run `git submodule add https://github.com/F-RDY/llama.git`.
3. Using something like [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo), set up your project to sync `Llama/src` into Roblox Studio!

### Method 4: Package manager

## Usage

### Basic usage

To use Llama, simply require it as a module from where you installed it! It is also recommended that you set `Llama.Dictionary`, `Llama.List`, and `Llama.Set` to their own variables; otherwise, you'll be typing a lot!

```lua
-- Other modules...
local Llama = require(LlamaPath)

local Dictionary = Llama.Dictionary
local List = Llama.List
local Set = Llama.Set
```

### Usage with [Roact](https://github.com/Roblox/roact/) and [Rodux](https://github.com/Roblox/rodux)

Rodux requires your state to be immutable, so Llama is a great choice for manipulating it!

```lua
local function reducer(state, action)
	if action.type == "Add" then
		return Dictionary.merge(state, {
			counter = counter + 1
		})
	elseif action.type == "Subtract" then
		return Dictionary.merge(state, {
			counter = counter - 1
		})
	end
end
```
